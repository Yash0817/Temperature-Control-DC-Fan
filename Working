Initially, when reference temperature is 23 degree Celsius, speed of fan is nearly 
100 rpm. When temperature increases to 27-degree Celsius speed of fan also 
increases to 900 rpm. When temperature is maintained stable, speed of fan also

remains constant. When temperature steeply rises to 37-degree Celsius speed 
rises simultaneously to 2700 rpm. Figure (3) depicts the simulation figure.
