A fan is usually controlled manually by using a switch. This non-innovative 
approach leads to wasted human effort and electricity. To overcome this issue, a 
temperature controlled, automatic fan is proposed in our study. The automatic 
control fan uses a microcontroller to sense the temperature of its environment 
with the help of the temperature sensor (thermistor) that measures the temperature 
of the environment. The desired temperature setpoint had been programmed on 
the microcontroller with the Arduino program and can be changed according to 
the needs of the user using switches connected to the controller circuit, the 
temperature sensor reads the temperature. A TINKERCAD model is developed 
to demonstrate the switching of the DC motor (fan) when in the desired 
temperature range.
Additionally, a MATLAB Simulink model can be used to simulate the required 
circuit necessary for speed control of the fan Application of various blocks such as 
heat generation unit, PWM unit, H Bridge, DC fan, rotational sensors and 
converters shows us the complete flow of energy and its conversion. Each block 
has different set-off values to be set and the output varies accordingly. Such as 
value at heat generation unit can be set at various values and thermistor senses 
this change. Now thermistor has its own specification of resistance, reference 
temperature and temperature coefficient. All these values are varied within range 
and speed of fan.
